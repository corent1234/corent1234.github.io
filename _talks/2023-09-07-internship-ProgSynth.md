I did a 2 month internship at the LaBRI computer science lab in Bordeaux, France on the project [ProgSynth](https://github.com/nathanael-fijalkow/ProgSynth). I tried to adapt the restarts method from SAT solvers to program synthesis under the supervision of Théo Matricon and Nathanaël Fijalkow.

You can find the slides of my presentation [here](/files/pdf/slides_progsynth.pdf). In French only, I'm sorry.
