Welcome! I am a computer science major at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) where I study various fields ranging from artificial intelligence to category theory. My goal is to work as both a teacher and a researcher. You can find more information about this on the different sections of this page. I hope this presentation will pique your interest in my work.

Feel free to send me an email at felix.yvonnet@gmail.com for whatever reason, I don't bite online.
