During our system architecture class we were asked to implement a shell in C using the `exec` command. 

I tried to copy as perfectly as I could the caracteristics of my shell. It can also performs some funny interactions between the launched shell program and your own shell. For example you can have local variables that only lives inside of the program and global variables that are the one on your real shell.

I imlemented all the basic behaviours of a shell: ranging from piplines to redirections or signal handling. You can find more information on the GitHub repo.
