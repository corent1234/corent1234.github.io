Ran a stand at 2023 event "Fête de la Science". It aimed at introducing some computer science concepts to children from 5 to 18 years old and dive into more advanced concepts for interested people.

We introduced programming and fondational concepts such as cybersecurity, sorting algorithms, binary encoding or error-correcting code. For more details look at the description of each that I may have provided below.

For the programming aspect, we used the [micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) platform. I wrote some exercises to introduce many fun aspects of programming ranging from variables (for the younger) to RSA (for the more advanced). You can find some of the exercises in the following page : [https://leojuguet.github.io/fete-de-la-science2023/](https://leojuguet.github.io/fete-de-la-science2023/)
