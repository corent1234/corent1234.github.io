Ran a stand at 2023 event "Fête de la Science". It aimed at introducing some computer science concepts to children from 5 to 18 years old and dive into more advanced concepts for all kind of interested people.

We introduced programming and fondational concepts such as cybersecurity, sorting algorithms, binary encoding or error-correcting code. For more details look at the description of each that I may have provided below.

You can find a [list of exercises](https://perso.crans.org/tjester/fete_de_la_science/F%c3%aate_des_sciences_microbit.pdf) (in French only) that will introduce you to various concepts of programming _via_ a Scratch like toy language: [micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/). The exercises were designed for a wide range of users going from introduction to variables up to RSA encryption. However they don't intend to replace a course and are more focused on oral interactions between the learner and a referent.

For the programming aspect, we used the [micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) platform. This platform allows us to build an environment to guide the learner more efficiently. </br>
